# UniContract

**UniContract** is a tool designed to simplify multi-language integration by providing a shared interface contract. It generates platform-specific code from a single interface definition, ensuring consistency, flexibility, and scalability across different systems.

## Features

- **Cross-Language Support**: Easily integrate systems written in different programming languages.
- **Unified Interface**: Generate consistent code from a single interface definition.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for large-scale, multi-language projects.
- **Redundancy-Free**: Eliminates the need to define interfaces multiple times.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Promotes simpler, more maintainable code.

## Installation and Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unicontract.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd unicontract

# Follow setup instructions based on your environment
# Example: Run installation script or configure dependencies

# Example Interface Definition (user-service.txt)
#
# interface UserService {
#   method getUser(userId: string) -> User
# }
#
# interface User {
#   property id: string
#   property name: string
# }

# To generate code for multiple languages from the interface definition:
unicontract generate --input user-service.txt --languages java,python,go

# This will generate the necessary code files for the UserService interface
# in Java, Python, and Go.
