#UniContract

UniContract is a tool designed to simplify multi-language integration by providing a shared interface contract. It generates platform-specific code from a single interface definition, ensuring consistency, flexibility, and scalability across different systems.

Features
Cross-Language Support: Easily integrate systems written in different programming languages.
Unified Interface: Generate consistent code from a single interface definition.
Scalability: Ideal for large-scale, multi-language projects.
Redundancy-Free: Eliminates the need to define interfaces multiple times.
Ease of Maintenance: Promotes simpler, more maintainable code.
Installation
To install UniContract, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions for your preferred environment.

bash
Kód másolása
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unicontract.git
cd unicontract
# Follow setup instructions
Usage
Define your interface contract in a custom, language-agnostic syntax.
Use the UniContract tool to generate code in the target languages.
Implement the generated code in your respective system.
Example Interface Definition
plaintext
Kód másolása
interface UserService {
  method getUser(userId: string) -> User
}

interface User {
  property id: string
  property name: string
}
In this example, we define a UserService interface with a getUser method that takes a userId and returns a User object. The User object has id and name properties.

Generate Code:
To generate code for multiple languages from the interface definition, run:

bash
Kód másolása
unicontract generate --input user-service.txt --languages java,python,go
This will generate the necessary code files for the UserService interface in Java, Python, and Go.
